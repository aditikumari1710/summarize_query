Heart Anatomy
Where is the Heart Located?
• In the thorax (this is 
about between your 
neck and your belly 
button)
• Behind the rib cage and 
lungs
• It’s slightly to the left of 
the center of your body
• Your heart is about the 
size of your fist

Blood Circulation
• The heart pumps blood 
to the lungs where it is 
oxygenated and then 
pumps that blood to 
the rest of the body
• This is done through 
four major vessels that 
takes blood into the 
heart and pumps it out 
of the heart through 
the following route

Blood Circulation
1. Blood from the body 
enters the heart through 
the vena cavas
2. Blood is pumped 
through the right side of 
the heart and then to the 
lungs through the 
pulmonary veins
3. Oxygenated blood 
returns to the left side of 
the heart through the 
pulmonary arteries
4. And is pumped to the 
rest of the body through 
the aorta

The Chambers of the Heart
• The heart is divided into 
the left and right 
chamber by the septum
• Each side of the heart is 
divided into an atrium 
(top) and a ventricle 
(bottom)

The Valves of the Heart
The chambers of the heart are 
separated by the following 
valves
Atrioventricular valves
• Tricuspid valve 
– Separates right atrium and 
ventricle
• Mitral Valve (bicuspid)
– Separates left atrium and 
ventricle
Semilunar valves
• Aortic value
– Separates the left ventricle 
from the aorta
• Pulmonic valve
– Separates right ventricle from 
the pulmonary artery

The Muscles of the Heart
• The heart has specific 
muscles that cause the 
heart to contract and 
open and close the heart 
values. Some of these 
muscles are:
• Trabeculae Carneae
– Irregular muscles of the 
ventricles
• Chordae Tendineae
– Small cords that connect 
the heart values to the 
papillary muscles

The Heart Beat
• The sound of your heart 
beating has two parts
• S1 (“lub”) is when the AV 
values of your heart close 
and blood is pushed out 
of the heart to the rest of 
the body. This is called 
systole
• S2 (“dub”) is when the 
semilunar values of the 
heart closes and the heart 
fills with blood. This is 
called diastole.
